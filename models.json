    "description": "## Model description  GPT-2 is a transformers model pretrained on a very large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it was trained to guess the next word in sentences.  More precisely, inputs are sequences of continuous text of a certain length and the targets are the same sequence, shifted one token (word or piece of word) to the right. The model uses internally a mask-mechanism to make sure the predictions for the token `i` only uses the inputs from `1` to `i` but not the future tokens.  This way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks. The model is best at what it was pretrained for however, which is generating texts from a prompt.  This is the **smallest** version of GPT-2, with 124M parameters.   **Related Models:** [GPT-Large](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-large), [GPT-Medium](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-medium) and [GPT-XL](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-xl)  ## Intended uses & limitations  You can use the raw model for text generation or fine-tune it to a downstream task. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=gpt2) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.  "

    "description": "b\"## Changes in this fork  This repository contains the model from the [stabilityai/StableBeluga2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/StableBeluga2) repository with the following changes:  1. **Storing weights in `bfloat16` instead of `float32`.**     This leads to 2x smaller files and a small quality loss, which is not significant compared to the loss caused by NF4 quantization used in Petals by default. 1. **Storing weights in small shards.**     Each transformer block is stored in its own shard (1.71 GB each). The input and output embeddings and adjacent layernorms are in a separate shard (1.05 GB) too.     This way, Petals clients and servers don't have to download any excess data besides the layers they actually use. 1. **Using [Safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) instead of Pickle.**     This allows faster loading with smaller RAM requirements.  We provide the original README below.

This restricted access has limited researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to study how and > why these large language models work, hindering progress on improving known challenges in areas > such as robustness, bias, and toxicity.  > We present Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M > to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers.

Our aim in developing this suite of OPT models is to enable reproducible and responsible research at scale, and > to bring more voices to the table in studying the impact of these LLMs. Definitions of risk, harm, bias, and toxicity, etc., should be articulated by the > collective research community as a whole, which is only possible when models are available for study.  ## Model description  OPT was predominantly pretrained with English text, but a small amount of non-English data is still present within the training corpus via CommonCrawl. The model was pretrained using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. OPT belongs to the same family of decoder-only models like [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). As such, it was pretrained using the self-supervised causal language modedling objective.  For evaluation, OPT follows [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) by using their prompts and overall experimental setup.

Qwen-1.8B is a Transformer-based large language model, which is pretrained on a large volume of data, including web texts, books, codes, etc. Additionally, based on the pretrained Qwen-1.8B, we release Qwen-1.8B-Chat, a large-model-based AI assistant, which is trained with alignment techniques. This repository is the one for Qwen-1.8B-Chat.  The features of Qwen-1.8B include: 1. **Low-cost deployment**: We provide int4 and int8 quantized versions, the minimum memory requirment for inference is less than 2GB, generating 2048 tokens only 3GB of memory usage. The minimum memory requirment of finetuning is only 6GB.  2. **Large-scale high-quality training corpora**: It is pretrained on over 2.2 trillion tokens, including Chinese, English, multilingual texts, code, and mathematics, covering general and professional fields. The distribution of the pre-training corpus has been optimized through a large number of ablation experiments. 3. **Good performance**: It supports 8192 context length and significantly surpasses existing open-source models of similar scale on multiple Chinese and English downstream evaluation tasks (including commonsense, reasoning, code, mathematics, etc.), and even surpasses some larger-scale models in several benchmarks. See below for specific evaluation results. 4. **More comprehensive vocabulary coverage**: Compared with other open-source models based on Chinese and English vocabularies, Qwen-1.8B uses a vocabulary of over 150K tokens. This vocabulary is more friendly to multiple languages, enabling users to directly further enhance the capability for certain languages without expanding the vocabulary. 5. **System prompt**: Qwen-1.8B-Chat can realize roly playing, language style transfer, task setting, and behavior setting by using system prompt.  For more details about the open-source model of Qwen-1.8B-Chat, please refer to the [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen) code repository.* python 3.8 and above * pytorch 1.12 and above, 2.0 and above are recommended * CUDA 11.4 and above are recommended (this is for GPU users, flash-attention users, etc.)  "

This restricted access has limited researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to study how and > why these large language models work, hindering progress on improving known challenges in areas > such as robustness, bias, and toxicity.  > We present Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M > to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We train the OPT models to roughly match  > the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models, while also applying the latest best practices in data > collection and efficient training. Our aim in developing this suite of OPT models is to enable reproducible and responsible research at scale, and > to bring more voices to the table in studying the impact of these LLMs. Definitions of risk, harm, bias, and toxicity, etc., should be articulated by the > collective research community as a whole, which is only possible when models are available for study.  ## Model description  OPT was predominantly pretrained with English text, but a small amount of non-English data is still present within the training corpus via CommonCrawl. The model was pretrained using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. OPT belongs to the same family of decoder-only models like [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). As such, it was pretrained using the self-supervised causal language modedling objective.  For evaluation, OPT follows [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) by using their prompts and overall experimental setup.

Although phi-2 performs very well, it does not support the Korean language and does not have a tokenizer trained on Korean corpous, so tokenizing Korean text will use many times more tokens than English tokens.  To overcome these limitations, I trained the model using an open-license Korean corpus and some English corpus.  The reasons for using the English corpus together are as follows:     1. The goal is to preserve the excellent performance of the existing model by preventing catastrophic forgetting.      2. Mixing English and Korean prompts usually produces better results than using all prompts in Korean.   Since my role is not as a working developer, but as an solutions architect helping customers with quick PoCs/prototypes, and I was limited by AWS GPU resources available, I only trained with 5GB of data instead of hundreds of GB of massive data.  #"

    "description": "b'## BioGPT  Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain. Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.  You can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. Since the generation relies on some randomness, we set a seed for reproducibility:  ```python >>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed >>> from transformers import BioGptTokenizer, BioGptForCausalLM >>> model = BioGptForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/biogpt\") >>> tokenizer = BioGptTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/biogpt\") >>> generator = pipeline(\\'text-generation\\', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer) >>> set_seed(42) >>> generator(\"COVID-19 is\", max_length=20, num_return_sequences=5, do_sample=True) [{\\'generated_text\\': \\'COVID-19 is a disease that spreads worldwide and is currently found in a growing proportion of the population\\'},  {\\'generated_text\\': \\'COVID-19 is one of the largest viral epidemics in the world.\\'},  {\\'generated_text\\': \\'COVID-19 is a common condition affecting an estimated 1.1 million people in the United States alone.\\'},  {\\'generated_text\\': \\'COVID-19 is a pandemic, the incidence has been increased in a manner similar to that in other\\'},  {\\'generated_text\\': \\'COVID-19 is transmitted via droplets, air-borne, or airborne transmission.\\'}] ```  Here is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:  ```python from transformers import BioGptTokenizer, BioGptForCausalLM tokenizer = BioGptTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/biogpt\") model = BioGptForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/biogpt\") text = \"Replace me by any text you\\'d like.\" encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\\'pt\\') output = model(**encoded_input) ```  Beam-search decoding:  ```python import torch from transformers import BioGptTokenizer, BioGptForCausalLM, set_seed  tokenizer = BioGptTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/biogpt\") model = BioGptForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/biogpt\")  sentence = \"COVID-19 is\" inputs = tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors=\"pt\")  set_seed(42)  with torch.no_grad():     beam_output = model.generate(**inputs,                                 min_length=100,                                 max_length=1024,                                 num_beams=5,                                 early_stopping=True                                 ) tokenizer.decode(beam_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True) \\'COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has spread to more than 200 countries and territories, including the United States (US), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA), as of March 11, 2020, with more than 800,000 confirmed cases and more than 800,000 deaths.\\' ```  ## Citation  If you find BioGPT useful in your research, please cite the following paper:  ```latex @article{10.1093/bib/bbac409,     author = {Luo, Renqian and Sun, Liai and Xia, Yingce and Qin, Tao and Zhang, Sheng and Poon, Hoifung and Liu, Tie-Yan},     title = \"{BioGPT: generative pre-trained transformer for biomedical text generation and mining}\",     journal = {Briefings in Bioinformatics},     volume = {23},     number = {6},     year = {2022},     month = {09},     abstract = \"{Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain.

This restricted access has limited researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to study how and > why these large language models work, hindering progress on improving known challenges in areas > such as robustness, bias, and toxicity.  > We present Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M > to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We train the OPT models to roughly match  > the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models, while also applying the latest best practices in data > collection and efficient training. Our aim in developing this suite of OPT models is to enable reproducible and responsible research at scale, and > to bring more voices to the table in studying the impact of these LLMs. Definitions of risk, harm, bias, and toxicity, etc., should be articulated by the > collective research community as a whole, which is only possible when models are available for study.  ## Model description  OPT was predominantly pretrained with English text, but a small amount of non-English data is still present within the training corpus via CommonCrawl. The model was pretrained using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. OPT belongs to the same family of decoder-only models like [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). As such, it was pretrained using the self-supervised causal language modedling objective.  For evaluation, OPT follows [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) by using their prompts and overall experimental setup.

    "description": "b\"## Model Summary  The language model Phi-1.5 is a Transformer with **1.3 billion** parameters. It was trained using the same data sources as [phi-1](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1), augmented with a new data source that consists of various NLP synthetic texts. When assessed against benchmarks testing common sense, language understanding, and logical reasoning, Phi-1.5 demonstrates a nearly state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 10 billion parameters.  We **did not** fine-tune Phi-1.5 either for **instruction following or through reinforcement learning from human feedback**. The intention behind crafting this open-source model is to provide the research community with a non-restricted small model to explore vital safety challenges, such as reducing toxicity, understanding societal biases, enhancing controllability, and more.  For a safer model release, we exclude generic web-crawl data sources such as common-crawl from the training. This strategy prevents direct exposure to potentially harmful online content, enhancing the model's safety without RLHF. However, the model is still vulnerable to generating harmful content. We hope the model can help the research community to further study the safety of language models.  Phi-1.5 can write poems, draft emails, create stories, summarize texts, write Python code (such as downloading a Hugging Face transformer model), etc.  ## How to Use  Phi-1.5 has been integrated in the `transformers` version 4.37.0, please ensure that you are using a version equal or higher than it.  \""

Similar to Llama Guard, it can be used for classifying content in both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and in LLM responses (response classification). It acts as an LLM – it generates text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated. Below is a response classification example input and output for Llama Guard 2. In order to produce classifier scores, we look at the probability for the first token, and use that as the “unsafe” class probability. We can then apply score thresholding to make binary decisions." },

While in some cases the public > can interact with these models through paid APIs, full model access is currently limited to only a > few highly resourced labs. This restricted access has limited researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to study how and > why these large language models work, hindering progress on improving known challenges in areas > such as robustness, bias, and toxicity.  > We present Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M > to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We train the OPT models to roughly match  > the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models, while also applying the latest best practices in data > collection and efficient training. Our aim in developing this suite of OPT models is to enable reproducible and responsible research at scale, and > to bring more voices to the table in studying the impact of these LLMs. Definitions of risk, harm, bias, and toxicity, etc., should be articulated by the > collective research community as a whole, which is only possible when models are available for study.  ## Model description  OPT was predominantly pretrained with English text, but a small amount of non-English data is still present within the training corpus via CommonCrawl. The model was pretrained using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective. OPT belongs to the same family of decoder-only models like [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). As such, it was pretrained using the self-supervised causal language modedling objective.  For evaluation, OPT follows [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) by using their prompts and overall experimental setup.
